Create a list of products each having a name, price, image and an Add to Cart button.
Display the items' image, name, price and quantity currently in Cart below the list.


Using JavaScript, implement the below functionalities :
1. The User should be able to add the product to cart.
2. The cart should have a Remove button to remove a particular product.
3. The user could increase the quantity of any product.
4. The total price should also be visible to the user below the cart at all times and should update as and when the cart contents or product quantities change.
5. Create a purchase button. Clicking on it, will display a Thank You message to the user and remove all the products from the userâ€™s cart.


Use external CSS for designing and external JS.
